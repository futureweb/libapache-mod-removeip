1.0b Removed the debian folder

1.0a Arranged the apache 1.3 and 2.0 stuff into subdirectories so that
     the .c file could have the same name in each case.  This is tidier
     since the .c file's name turns up in the apache config.

     This module has been running for a while now on cat.org.au's servers
     so I figure once the files have been tidied up just a little,  it 
     can be called a 1.0 release.

0.2  Added Apache 2 compatibility

0.1  first version to be distributed
